k6.io Stress Test Guide
This README provides a tutorial on how to download, install, and run a k6.io stress test script. k6.io is a popular open-source load testing tool that allows you to simulate user traffic and analyze your application's performance under different load scenarios.

Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, you need to have basic knowledge of:

Command-line usage
JavaScript (for writing or understanding the test scripts)
Step 1: Install k6.io
Windows
Download the latest k6.io release for Windows from the official releases page.

Extract the downloaded zip archive to a folder of your choice.

Add the extracted folder to your system's PATH environment variable.

macOS
You can install k6.io using Homebrew:

bash
Copy
brew install k6
Linux
Download the latest k6.io release for Linux from the official releases page.

Extract the downloaded tarball:

bash
Copy
tar -xf k6-v0.x.y-linux-amd64.tar.gz
Move the extracted k6 binary to a directory in your system's PATH:
bash
Copy
sudo mv k6-v0.x.y-linux-amd64/k6 /usr/local/bin/
Step 2: Write a Test Script
Create a new JavaScript file called test-script.js and add the following content:

javascript
Copy
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 10 },
    { duration: '1m', target: 10 },
    { duration: '30s', target: 0 },
  ],
};

export default function () {
  const response = http.get('https://httpbin.org/get');
  sleep(1);
}
This script will send GET requests to https://httpbin.org/get and ramp up from 0 to 10 virtual users over 30 seconds, maintain 10 virtual users for 1 minute, and then ramp down to 0 virtual users over the next 30 seconds.

Feel free to modify the script according to your application's requirements, such as changing the target URL, request method, or load configuration.

Step 3: Run the Test Script
To run the k6.io test script, open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder containing your test-script.js file. Then, run the following command:

bash
Copy
k6 run test-script.js
The k6.io test will execute, simulating the virtual users according to the configuration in the options object. You will see real-time performance metrics in the console output.

Step 4: Analyze the Test Results
After the test completes, review the console output and analyze the performance metrics, such as response times, request rates, and error rates. These metrics can help you identify potential bottlenecks or issues in your application.

You can also use k6.io's result output options to export the test results to various formats or external systems for further analysis and visualization.
